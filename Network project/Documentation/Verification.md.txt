Verification.md

Purpose:
To record all final testing and validation results after full configuration.

Why I did this:
To prove the network works — all routers, VLANs, DHCP, SSH, and port-security features function correctly.

What I did:

Verified inter-VLAN ping between hosts

Checked OSPF learned routes

Confirmed DHCP leases

Tested SSH access

Checked switch port security status

Result:
✅ All VLANs reachable
✅ OSPF routes exchanged
✅ DHCP working
✅ SSH login successful
✅ Port-security enforced

Checking connection to device in different vlan.
