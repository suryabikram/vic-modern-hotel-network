
Purpose:
To configure OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) as the dynamic routing protocol between routers.

Why I did this:
I needed automatic route exchange between routers instead of static routes. OSPF allows each router to share its networks with others dynamically and efficiently.

What I did:

Used router ospf 10 to start the process

Advertised all VLAN and serial networks using network commands

Verified neighbor relationships with show ip ospf neighbor

Result:
Each router learned remote networks automatically.
