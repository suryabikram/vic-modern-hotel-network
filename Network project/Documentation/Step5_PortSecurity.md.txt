Step5_PortSecurity

Purpose:
To implement switch-level security by limiting access on IT department switch ports.

Why I did this:
To prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. Using port-security sticky MAC, the switch learns the legitimate device’s MAC address and shuts down if another tries to connect.

What I did:

Configured port Fa0/4 for port security

Allowed maximum 1 MAC address

Used sticky MAC and shutdown violation mode

Result:
Verified with show port-security interface fa0/4 — Test-PC’s MAC address was learned and port secured.
