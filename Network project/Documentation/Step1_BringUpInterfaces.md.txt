# Step 1 — Bring Up WAN and LAN Interfaces

Purpose:
To document how I brought up all routers’ physical and logical interfaces. This was the first step to ensure WAN and LAN links were active before configuring higher-level protocols.

Why I did this:
Without activating interfaces (no shutdown), the routers remain disconnected, preventing OSPF neighbors and DHCP from functioning.

What I did:

Enabled serial interfaces between routers for WAN links

Enabled GigabitEthernet0/0 interfaces for VLAN trunking

Verified using show ip interface brief
example: Floor 1 router
